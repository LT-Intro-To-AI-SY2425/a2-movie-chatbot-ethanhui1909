# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The most diffiuclt part for me while completing the match function was getting used to how python syntax and methods work. I had no clue that python had various methods that could alleviate my difficulties in trying to do certain things in python (i.e. inserting strings within a string with join().)


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
Using the return statement of the match function, I could take the output list and use the indexes within that list to get specific information for what the user may possibly want. If the user's input statement wanted movies from a certain director, the match statement could return the director's name and then I could use that information to retrieve movies made by that paritcular director. In other words, I could use the information given from the match function to retrieve specific information regarding movies to the user.
